In JavaScript, undefined is a primitive value that represents the absence of a defined value.

ðŸ”¹ What is undefined in JavaScript?

It means "a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value yet."

ðŸ§  Examples:
1. Unassigned Variable:
let x;
console.log(x); // Output: undefined


â†’ x exists, but no value has been assigned.

2. Missing Function Return:
function greet() {
  // no return
}

console.log(greet()); // Output: undefined


â†’ The function runs but doesnâ€™t return anything.

3. Accessing Non-Existent Property:
const person = { name: "Ali" };
console.log(person.age); // Output: undefined


â†’ The property age doesnâ€™t exist.
